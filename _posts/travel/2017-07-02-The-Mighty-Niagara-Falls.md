Straddling the United States and Canadian border with New York on one side and Ontario on the other a river cuts through unyeilding rocks with all its might, only to meet
a giant hole carved in earth. The powerful stream of water falling over the edge makes one of the most beautiful natural wonders of earth, The Niagara Falls. Even though
the roaring water can be heard, the spraying water can be seen from some distance away, the niagara falls does not fully reveal all its beauty until you kneel to its knee.
I wish I knew how to properly use my camera to capture the moments.

There is a ride called **Maid of the Mist** that takes one close to the falling water. Close enough to get soaked up in spraying water. When it gets in the middle of the
**Horseshoe Fall**, its water dust everywhere. Through the mist there is water falling over from every direction. Eyes fixed on the unfathomable rush of water. Overwhelmed
by the uncanny power of nature, it feels like the edge of the world.
