What is the meaning of life? Is there any divine purpose set by a higher being that we are too busy to recognize? Do we live for ourselves? Or do we live for someone else? If life is the light why is there the darkness of death? Is death the ultimate triumph of life? From the time unknown some lazy ass people didn’t have anything to do other than asking and pondering upon these questions which they knew didn’t have any answers. Yet they spent their time trying to find answers. Such retards! These retarded people however can see the world from a divine angle (not measurable with sextant) that we busy ass people cannot see. We live our every day trying to impress others (as I am doing right now) and not trying achieve something more than our earthly desires. Life is meaningless if you have too short to live. Because you need to prepare yourself to live it. At the same time it is also meaningless if you live forever. What’s the point of living if you always have another tomorrow to be alive. These two extreme ends does not let us make a meaning of our achievement. This shortage of time drive us to do whatever we do. We come to this earth and from that very moment begin the race of life! And somewhere in the middle we stumble upon the enlightenment, why are we running? Life is short. We all know that. But no one pays attention to it that much. What if you knew how your life is numbered? Would that change how your perspective of life? Would you find your ambition of becoming the next CEO of some corporate world sick? Would you dedicate your life to achieve greater good for humanity?

---------------------------------------

You cannot exactly know how your days are numbered on earth. However you can have an idea of it. Some crazy ass people decided to do that for you with an online tool. Go to this address [http://theblog.de/projects/carpediem/](http://theblog.de/projects/carpediem/) and enter your birth day. Assuming that the earth will not be hit by some disaster of any kind the tool will give you how many weeks you have left in your life depending on the average life expectancy of your location. It gives you how many weeks you have already passed in grey and how many weeks you have left in black (btw that is not my birthday :( I am an old man :’( ). You can see it from the perspective of months and years also. Interesting? Well things will get more interesting.

Although it is sickening to see how much time you have left it is more practical to see how time actually available to you out of these available time. You will not pass the rest of your life without sleeping. So go ahead and put a tick mark on sleep and press show me. Time is short. Isn’t it? Add work as well. 
How sick is this??
