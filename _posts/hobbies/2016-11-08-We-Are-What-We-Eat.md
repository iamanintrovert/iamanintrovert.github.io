In these days of Hi-Tech world with thouch of modernism influcencing almost all aspects of our lives, we (or at least me) do not put much thought about how we receive
our most basic needs for example food. We take it for granted that there will be something available out there in the market when we need it. We have embraced the 
blessings of modern agriculture since the first men began it around 10,000 years ago. As the humans scattered all over the globe some group became completely isolated
from the rest of world in such a way that they are as pristine as they have been from the begining of human history. Some groups still gather their food by hunting and
gathering. This gives anthropologits a glimps into how the dietery behaviour evolved throughout history. I stumbled upon One such effort to capture how these isolated
groups collect food and how it shapes their lives. A series of videos on youtube from National Geographic [^1] photographer Mathieu Paley named _We Are What We Eat_.

Only one thought went through my head after watching these videos. How lucky we are!
