With their hard work, support and my dedication I was able to land myself into the best educational institution of the country, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and became the first person to go to a university in my family lineage.

This website serves as a way to let others know about my work. This is also a place where I keep my notes and ideas for my own refrennce. Please visit my blog section. You may get infected with some ideas the same way I got infected. I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) which is hosted in [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. I slightly modified the theme to fit my purpose. I used some images from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which are also free.
