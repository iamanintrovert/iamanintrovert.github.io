I hail from the town of Bogra, home to the ancient capital of [Pundrabordhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasthangarh) in Bangladesh. The *Md* in my name stands for *Mohammad*. I grew up in a family that appreciates the value of a good education. With their hard work, support and my dedication I was able to get into the best educational institution of the country, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and became the first person to go to a university in my family lineage.

I have always been intrigued by seemingly unrelated fields working together in unexpected ways to solve the great problems that humankind faces today. Like the innovation of [50 cent microscope](https://www.ted.com/talks/manu_prakash_a_50_cent_microscope_that_folds_like_origami?language=en) which cuts down the cost of disease disgnostic to a level that people can afford who are plagued by water born diseases in underdeveloped places. Like the innovation of [Reinforcement Learning](http://www.incompleteideas.net/) which makes machine think like humans. Like the idea of having bacteria function like transistor in [Synthetic Biology](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132/599). Like the idea of using [DNA as memory device](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6102/1628). Or like the idea of building biologically equivalent brain in semiconductor circuits.

In my undergrad I worked in Electromagnetic Metamaterials. But the field of Neuromorphic Engineering attracted me more. So I decided to pursue PhD in this field. 

This website serves as a way to let others know about my work. This is also a place where I keep my notes and ideas for my own refrennce. Please visit my blog section. You may find some ideas as interesting as I found them to be. I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) which is hosted in [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. I slightly modified the theme to fit my purpose. I used some images from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which are also free.
