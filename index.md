Hello! I am Md Munir Hasan. Currently a PhD student in electrical engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte under supervision of [Dr. Jeremy Holleman](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/research/iss/index.html). Under his supervision I obtained MS form the University of Tennesse Knoxville.

I work on the exciting field of **Neuromorphic Engineering** where *semiconductor device circuit design*, *machine learning*, *analog computaton* and *neruocience* intersect. I focus on ultra low power mixed signal machine learning circuit and systems using **spiking neural network**. I design circuits like neuron, synapse by exploiting the physics of device operation. I carry out simulations of spiking neural network with the device non idealities included in order to predict the outcome of the network in a physical chip. I combine python, SKILL, ocean scripting to generate automated schematic and layouts of network in Cadence Virtuoso.
